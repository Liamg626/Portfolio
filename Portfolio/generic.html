									<h1>Hello,</h1>
									<p>My name is Liam Gleeson; a self-taught software developer currently living in Leeds. I started learing with SQL and Python through websites and courses such as Khan Academy and w3schools to learn basics. After enjoying this I started to learn HTML and CSS; leading eventually to Javascript.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/aboutme.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I started working with excel, SQL and Tableau back in September 2022. I've been working with data for the majority of my working life through hospital work where data is the most important asset I had; and through being a bar manager where Power BI and SQl was used in back of house to represent reports and sales findings. As interesting as this was I'd always wanted to work with Python in software development; try my hand at actually making something as apposed to recycling datatsets.</p>
								<p>From there I started working through Python course and trying myt hand at the coding challenge over at codewars. Once I felt comfortable I slowly started to look in to HTML, CSS and JavaScript which is where I continue to put my time now. Python will always be my strong suit and where I feel most comfortable but I'm enjoying branching out and working to improve my knowledge of front and back end development; hopefully one day working to be a full stack developer.</p>
